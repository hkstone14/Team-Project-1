# Git commands and terminologies

There are various commands that Git provides but here are some basic git commands mentioned below.

## Repository
This is a local place/hub on your machine where the entire snapshot of your project is stored. Every minor change is stored and retrievable. Repository logs can easily be viewed and retrieved, i.e, you can jump to any older state of your code.

## Clone
* A clone is a working copy of a remote repository.
* The ‘git clone’ command downloads the remote repository and creates a working directory on your local machine.
* In addition, this command also stores a remote pointer reference from the local repository to the remote repository.

## Fork
* A fork is a copy of a repository. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project.
* Most commonly, forks are used to either propose changes to someone else's project or to use someone else's project as a starting point for your own idea.

### Propose changes to someone else's project
1. Fork the repository.
2. Make the fix.
3. Submit a pull request to the project owner.

## Branch
* A branch is a parallel, independent line of development.
* A branch lets you work on the same piece of code in your isolated workspace.
* Every branch has its own copy of the project history and develops on its own code. They are easily and often merged with each other.
