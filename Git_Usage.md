# Usage Of GIT

## What is GIT?

Git is a content version control system.It allows the users to keep multiple versions of a set of files and comfortably switch between versions and merge difference versions together.

## Why Git is important?

 Compared to the alternatives of Git, Git increases the productivity of your team members when they need to manage multiple versions of their stuff. 
 That means the code and config for developers, images and documents for designers. It’s a content version system for their working set.
 Critically, especially for developers, is that allows users to quickly switch context between the set of code they’re currently working with to any other branch or version, in a moment, with no fear of losing what their working on, and no fear of corrupting other versions. This is a significant time-saver.
