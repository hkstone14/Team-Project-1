# :point_right: Usage Of GIT

## What is GIT?

* Git is currently the most popular implementation of a distributed version control system.
* Git originates from the Linux kernel development and was founded in 2005 by Linus Torvalds. Nowadays it is used by many popular open source projects, e.g., the Android or the Eclipse developer teams, as well as many commercial organizations.
* The core of Git was originally written in the programming language C, but Git has also been re-implemented in other languages, e.g., Java, Ruby and Python.

Git is an **Open Source Distributed Version Control System**. 

## Control System:

* This basically means that Git is a content tracker. So Git can be used to store content — it is mostly used to store code due to the other features it provides.

## Version Control System:

* The code which is stored in Git keeps changing as more code is added. Also, many developers can add code in parallel. So Version Control System helps in handling this by maintaining a history of what changes have happened. Also, Git provides features like branches and merges, which I will be covering later.

## Distributed Version Control System:

* Git has a remote repository which is stored in a server and a local repository which is stored in the computer of each developer. This means that the code is not just stored in a central server, but the full copy of the code is present in all the developers’ computers. Git is a Distributed Version Control System since the code is present in every developer’s computer.
