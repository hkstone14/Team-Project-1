# :point_right: Usage of Docker

## What is Docker?

**Docker** is an open-source project that automates the development, deployment and running of applications inside isolated containers. Containers allow developers to bundle up an application with all of the parts it needs, such as libraries and other dependencies, and ship it as one package.

## Why use Docker?

There are various reasons to use Docker.

**1.** **Consistency:**
Docker provides a consistent environment for your application from development all the way through production — you run from the same starting point every time.

**2.** **Speed:**
We can rapidly run a new process on a server. Because the image is preconfigured and installed with the process you want to run, it takes the challenge of running a process out of the equation.

**3.** **Isolation:**
By default each Docker container that’s running is isolated from the network, the file system and other running processes.

**4.** **Layered file system:**
Starting from a base image, every change you make to a container or image becomes a new layer in the file system. As a result, file system layers are cached, reducing the number of repetitive steps during the Docker build process AND reducing the time it takes to upload and download similar images.
