# :point_right: Usage of Automated Testing

## What is Automated testing?
* Automated  Testing has a significant role in the lifecycle of software development. Unlike the traditional method of manual testing that is performed by humans and involves careful execution of the test steps, the Automation Testing utilizes automation tools to execute the test case suite. When the test suite is automated, it requires no further human intervention, which can have many advantages.
* Once deployed, the automated testing process performs various testing activities on its own, such as entering the test data into the System that is being subjected to the Test. It can also compare the ensuing results against the expected results, and calculate the difference. Finally, based on the observations, it can also generate detailed test reports on its own

## How automated testing add value?
* A software application has to be tested each time before a new release. It means, be it a minor change such elementary bug fixes or significant modifications such as the addition of new features, the changes made have to be tested thoroughly. It also means, retained functionalities of the software from its previous releases also have to be tested.
* However, when the number of versions of the application is few, and the total numbers of changes are not many, the process of manual testing can be carried out with ease. But, when the software application has gone through too many changes, then the total number of functionalities right from its first release can be too much to handle through manual testing. For this reason alone, automated testing can be the right option.

There are some **advantages** of automated testing mentioned below.
1. Surge in productivity:
By, using the automation testing mechanism, even the massive applications can be tested for accuracy with fewer resources and within the stipulated time, which can lead to an increase in the overall productivity.

2. Improve quality and consistency:
Computers running high-quality testing tools are the bedrock of mechanization of the testing process. As the human intervention in the process is kept to minimal, the probability of human errors would also decrease drastically, which leads to boost in the quality and consistency of the final product.

3. Decrease in redundancy and cost:
Unlike manual testing, the automated process is performed in a sequence by machines at incredible speeds. As the process is carried out in a sequence, the chance of repeating a given task is almost negligible. It means, there is no scope for repetitive work, which can lead to an elimination of redundancy.
